“Quantitative Methods in Sociology” 
SOC 312, Department of Sociology, University of Oregon 

TA (Spring 2024) and Instructor of Record (Winter 2026)

Course Description: This course will teach the fundamentals of analyzing numerical data in a social science context. Students will learn
effective ways of presenting informational summaries, the use of statistical inference from samples to populations,
the linear model that forms the basis of much social science research, and the ability to think critically about how to
consume statistical information. Emphasis will be on an intuitive understanding of statistical results, and their
practical application.

Learning Objectives:

1. Describe the distribution of quantitative and categorical variables using graphical and numerical
techniques.
2. Describe the relationships between variables using two-way tables, mean differences, and regression
models.
3. Conduct and interpret tests of statistical inference.
4. Interpret OLS regression model results from real research, including dummy variables and
interaction terms.
5. Become familiar with performing analysis using the R and RStudio statistical software.
