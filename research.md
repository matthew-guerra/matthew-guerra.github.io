# Papers Under Review and In Progress
**Navigating Ancestry and Racial Classification Amongst Multiracial Indigenous Americans**

Abstract:

How does proximity to a Homeland shape the racial decision-making process for individuals with mixed Indigenous ancestry?  Can rural residency account for the influence of the Homeland variable?  Using data from the American Community Survey (ACS) from 2010 to 2020, this study examines the relationship between geographic location and Indigenous self-identification by estimating multinomial logistic regression models. Findings reveal that living in a Homeland or being of Hispanic Origin were the strongest predictors of Indigenous alone identification. These results reinforce previous research on the Homeland variable as a key predictor of Indigenous racial identification while expanding on its application to an adult multiracial population. By examining how structural and spatial factors shape racial decision-making, this study contributes to a broader discussion on Indigenous identity formation, multiraciality, and the role of place in racial decision-making

# Active Research Projects
**Fire Resilience and Stewardship Futures**

Co-Investigator, Spring 2024 - Present

Increasing wildfire intensity calls for broader involvement in solutions and shifts within the fire management field to support diverse communities better. Despite this need, little research addresses how young people, ages 16-30, wish to contribute to fire resilience, and existing research lacks community focus and practical impact. This project partners with FireGen, a proven youth organization, to engage young people through surveys and listening circles to understand their visions for fire-resilient futures. Grounded in participatory and Indigenous research frameworks, the approach prioritizes youth voices and community priorities in shaping wildfire response.
